# hashcode-auto-submit



Last thursday it was the google hashcode, it's a huge competition around the world organized by google https://hashcode.withgoogle.com/ it's a fun hackathon that lasts 2 hours for the first round.

I made a first algorithm that randomly created output files and I wanted to see how far it could go. But to do that I had to automate the judge system interface. This is the result.
